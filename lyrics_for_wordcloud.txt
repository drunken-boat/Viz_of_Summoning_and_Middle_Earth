Flight of the Nazgul 
Why is life so precious
When living is but shreds of joy and pain
Of loss and gain
Of torment and resent
Hanging on a cliff edge
Clawing for a hold
The weak are pushed
The strong held back
The quiet cowed by the bold
More rain than sunshine
The warm outdoes the cold
Safety in numbers
But now we're all alone
I'm stretching out my arms now
I'm yearning for your love
Mist is all around us
Dark shadows fly above
The cold can kill you
Your body keeps me warm
We survey the view now
In the cold light of the dawn
Out on the cliff edge
Moss clings so easily 


Through the Valley of the Frozen Kingdom 
damned to a ghostly substance
created by a lesser god
damned to carry this burden
forever in your sour souls
damned to dig on rotten roots
you are doomed and none shall live
the essence that keeps you alive
nothing but venom injected by wrath


The Eternal Lands of Fire 
amned to a ghostly substance
created by a lesser god
damned to carry this burden
forever in your sour souls
damned to dig on rotten roots
you are doomed and none shall live
the essence that keeps you alive
nothing but venom injected by wrath


Dragons of Time 
on cold landscapes of ghostly substance
the dragon spreads its wings
the only dragon, creator of time
on paths where
once surrounded by night
throned the dragon of time now dwells
the swords dipped in blood
stone cold, washed away by time
none shall live and all shall die
immortal we stand
on the hills where the dragon flies
on the hills where dragon flies


Moondance 
Right in the dark
Flames burn the glade
You'll die, before we can try
The blood aprise, shall not worry
Your turn to pray
You must not die

In this place we're all, we'll be alone
But we pray and lord will grant us life
That's all I'll be
Break my spell

Right, but late
Called at the gates of
Place of bewitched
Don't worry now
The blood - a price
The shadows bouncing over me. 



Lugburz 
[Verse I]
"Cold be hand and heart and bone,
and cold be sleep under stone:
never more to wake on stony bed,
never, till the sun fails and the moon is dead.
In the black wind the stars shall die,
and still on gold here let them lie,
till the dark lord lifts his hand
over dead sea and withered land."

[Chorus]
"When the winter first begins to bite
and stones crack in the frosty night,
when pools are black and trees are bare,
it is evil in the wild to fare.
…
When the winter first begins to bite
and stones crack in the frosty night."

[Verse II]
"To lay down my will upon the Land, Lugburz
…
No sound disturbs this place of blackened souls
This winter walls of stone and ice behold thy might
Again I'm kneeling down to hear these strange tunes
of war
Night, oh beloved night, your wisdom floats into
my mind
and forms my thoughts of Middle-Earth
to build up a new mighty empire."

[Chorus] 


The Passing of the Grey Company 
Over the land there lies a long shadow,
Grief sights to West,
Long beside to field last arrive
In tomb still is lying dream.
To Minas Tirith White they’ve passed road
There is White Tower turned to shadow
They wreathed dying world to withering sound that
trembles,
To the tombs of king’s doom approaches.
Who shall call the forgotten people?
Whose shall the horn be?
Where the searched grey twilight
Where over dark wings lay
Far away over northern mountains
We shall hail now before cursed graves.
Over the land there lies a long shadow,
Westward reaching wings of darkness,
The tower trembles,
The dead awaken for the hour is come for the
oathbreakers;
At the stone of Erech they shall hear a horn in the
hills.
We rode under White Mountains,
We rode to kneel down before buried grave.
Far away, covered by shadows, White Mountains,
We’re here, pale towers raised up that high.
Over the land there lies a long shadow,
Westward reaching wings of darkness,
The tower trembles, to the tombs of kings.
Long… to field last arrive,
In tomb…
At the stone of Erech shall they hear…
Still is… still is going war…
The grey company now arrived... 


Morthond 
We heard horns in hills ringing
The swords shining in South-kingdom
Steeds went striding to the Stoningland
As winds in morning. War was there.
There run dark waters
Morthond, under mountains
Death in the morning and at day's end
Lords took and lowly...
[Chorus]
Grey now as tears gleaming silver,
Red it rolled then
Foam dyed with blood
Grey now as tears gleaming silver
Red then it rolled leave it’s water
Foam dyed with blood flamed at a sunset
As flowers mountains burned at evening.


Marching Homewards 
Here beside me, under endless howling winds
My dying race is wandering homewards,
Led by an old man to shores, that don't exist,
Just empty to sign, just emptiness sign remains...
Hour after hour, day after my lullaby is
Turning and falls gently on this sleeping land
Like a hawk which is trembling of cold…
Two years have passed
And still my race is wandering
Through foreign shores like awful
To endless we’ll try to rise…
Two years have passed
And still my race is wandering
Through foreign shores
My calling, my thoughts now are waking
My soul is now formed as a knife forwards
The heart of your heaven, and so I die…
My soul is now formed as a knife forwards
The heart of your heaven, and so I die.
Still my folk keeps on marching
My folk keeps on marching homewards
Still my race is wandering
My soul as a knife become
Here beside me, under endless howling winds
My dying race is wandering
Is wandering of the land
Led by an old man to shores, that don't exist,
Thy empty land to show us
Just emptiness remains
Two years have passed
And still my race is wandering
Through foreign shores
Through foreign shores to sunlight...
My soul is now formed as a knife
The heart of your heaven
And so to die...
My soul is now formed as a knife
The heart of your heaven
Two years have passed
And still they all are wandering
They passed desert-creature for the sunder
The death that taking soul still on keeping
My soul is now formed as a knife to heaven
The heart… 


Ungolianth
Come to me, my lady of a foreign shore
To pass on your knowledge to me,
Interrupt these peacefull lands
With your odem of pestilence
Your lifeform is living in the deepest twilight,
The depths of Avathar.
Your odem goes down the green rivers
And high up to the blue skies.
So high my throne, so cold as ice
It makes my blue eyes turn red
Between dark covers my stronghold Angband
[unreadable]
Your odem goes down the green rivers
And high up to the blue skies
To the wide open forests and
Mountains so high.
Far away to the unknown and at last
To destroy the two trees of life
On the hills of Ezellohar
So high my throne, so cold as ice…
Come to me, my lady of a foreign shore
To pass on your knowledge to me,
Interrupt these peacefull lands… 


Dagor Bragollach
In the year… 455 it began, the battle of rapid fire.
Announced threw flames,
More deadly than the third battle.
Streams of fire flowing out of Thangorodrim and
burned Ard-galen.
And with the flame a sea of orcs arrived,
And balorgs and Glaurung the dragon
Having received all his might now Dorthonion
broke down
First under this onset,
Angrod and Aegnor were killed and their folk
enslaved,
The riders of Maglor were sacrifices of the flames.
On the planes of Lothlann victory on our side the
triumph of Morgoth.
[unreadable]
Angrod and Aegnor were killed and their folk
enslaved.
The riders of maglor were sacrifices of the flames.
On the planes of Lothlann victory on our side the
triumph of Morgoth.
Streams of fire flow down the Thangorodrim… 


Through the Forest of Dol Guldur
The misty path through woods long past
Enshrined in silence and runes will keep
the secrets of Dol Guldur
Far away and over the cold fog
(our gleaming eyes are searching for a sign
and down to the deepest dungeons
and to the old forgotten lair)
[unreadable part]
We must leave now, before a new day breaks
to search for the pale gold
that once belonged to the forest
By the sounds of pounding hammers
that sound like bells of the elves
in our ears...
we are still searching in the underground
where our dark secrets sleep 


The Legend of the Master-Ring
[Part I]
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone.
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne.
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Ring to rule them all,
One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all,
And in the darkness bind them,
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
[Part II]
The earth was trembling by cloven hoofes…
And no stars shined in that night foreseen
The Morgul road was hidden by clowds of doom
And trembled again by the outburst of darkness.
Ten thousand orcs and trolls, paralyzed with fear…
of the Nazgul King.
[ending]
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind
them
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. 


Dor Daedeloth 
My heart for your word Ered Engrin,
To watch your folk, tired and small
All hope dies in its last breath.
You won’t fear us, for we won’t bring you
anything,
But a faded spirit, the essence of my frost cries.
My heart for your word, Dor Daedeloth,
You’ve seen the journey of time,
And let us half mortal being stride,
To watch you gave us the truth
And the solitude of mankind forever.
Five shilluettes are crossing the planes
To the westside… to the westside,
To the forest of the westerly nightfear,
Looking to the eye, to waking nightmares,
We are here, the battle seems to loose…
My heart for your word Ered Engrin,
And watch your folk, tired and small
All hope dies in its last breath.
You won’t fear us, for we won’t bring you
anything,
But a faded spirit, the essence of my frost cries.
My heart for your word, Dor Daedeloth,
You have seen the journey of time,
And let us half mortal being stride,
Take part of the truth, the key to solitude of men.
Wherever we go, wherever we stand,
Silence covers…
Five shilluettes are crossing the planes
To the wide opened forest of the west,
On and on they are traveling
The shilluettes are crossing doomed lands
That covered by grey clouds,
Their main goal is wait for Him.
Silence covers the bloodsoaked land,
And so we pass the mountains of Ered Gorgoroth.
Five shilluettes are crossing the planes
To the wide opened forest,
On and on they are traveling
In the direction of Hithlum… 



Nightshade Forests 
And in the glade a light was seen
Of stars and shadows shimmering
Immortal maiden elven-wise...
Long was the way through iron halls and darkling doors

And woods of nightshade morrowless
Elven-wise dance with me...
Cold be hand, heart and bone
And cold be my sleep under stone
Never more I'll wake on a snowy bed
Never - 'til the sun fails and the moon is dead

In the black winds the stars shall die
And still on gold here let them lie
'Til the dark lord lifts his hand
Over dead seas and withered land

And I'll fly away...
Where I dwell none can say
For into darkness fell my star
In Mordor where the shadows are 


Elfstone 
All that is gold does not glitter
All that is long does not last
All that is old does not wither
Not all that is over is past
And I may not get through in time
Oh, Elfstone - bearer of my green stone
In the south under snow a green stone thou shalt see
Elfstone - in the shadow of the dark throne
For the hour is at hand that long hath awaited thee
Greenleaf - bearer of the Elvenbow
Far beyond Mirkwood many trees on earth grow
Thy last shaft when thou hast shot
Under the mournful trees thou shalt walk
For dark are the waters of Kheledzaram
And my heart trembles at the thought that I may see them soon
I am longing for harmony - the freedom within me
Out of dark to the day's rising
I came crying in the sun - sword unsheathing
To hope's end I rode and to heart's breaking
Now for wrath
Now for ruin - and a red nightfall
When the black breath blows - and death's shadows grow
All lights pass
Life to the dying - in my hand lying
Shrivel like the old mist - like the winds go wailing
Lost and forgotten be - darker than the darkness
Where gates stand for ever shut
'Til the world is mended 


Khazad Dúm 
From ashes and fire be broken
A light from the shadows shall spring
Renewed shall be blade that was broken
The crownless shall again be king

The world is grey, the mountains old
The forge's fire is ashen and cold
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls
The darkness dwells in Druin's halls

The shadow lies upon his tomb
But still the sunken stars appeal
In the dark and windless Mirrormere
There lies his crown in water deep

'Til Druin wakes again from sleep
A deadly sword, a healing hand
A trumpet - voice, a burning hand
A lord of wisdom...

Fire and shadow - both defied
In Khazad-dûm his wisdom died
In joy thou hast lived

If thou hearest the cry
of the Gull on the shore
Thy soul shall then rest
in the forest no more... 


Kôr 
O fading town upon an island hill,
Old shadows linger in thine ancient gate,
Thy robe is grey, thine old heart now is still;
Thy towers silent in the mist await their crumbling end
While through the storeyed elms
The gliding black water leaves these inland realms,
And slips between long meadows to the sea,
Still bearing downward over murmurous falls
One day and then another to the sea
And slowly thither many years have gone

All thy trees, Kôrtirion, were bent,
And shook with sudden whispering lament:
For passing were the days, and doomed the nights
When flittering ghost-moths danced round
tapers in the moveless air nighttime

And doomed already were the radiant dawns,
The odour and the noise of meads,
when all thy trees were bent,
and shook with sudden whispering lament

And slowly thither many years have gone
since first the elves here built ancient, renowned Kôrtirion 


Unto a Long Glory... 
Over the land there lies the long shadow.
Westward reaching wings of darkness;
The tower trembles to the tombs of kings

The doom approaches the Dead awaken;
For the hour is come for the oathbreakers
At the stone of Erech they shall stand again
Hear there horn in hills enchants
Who shall call them
From grey twilight
Forgotten ones?

Out of doubt, out of dark
Hope rekindles, and hope in end
Over death, over dread
Over doom lifted
Out of loss, out of life
And out of doubt, out of dark
Over death, over dread
Out of loss,
Unto a long glory...

The heir of him to whom the oath they swore
From the North he shall come
And he shall pass the door
To the Paths of the Dead

Mourn not overmuch - mighty was the fallen
And war now calls us!

And hear there horn in hills ringing
Who shall call them
from grey twilight 


Over Old Hills 
The air was neither night or a day,
But faintly dark with softest light
When first glimmered into sight
The Cottage of Lost Play

You and me - we know that land
And often have been there in
The old days, old days
The dark child and a fair
Was it down the paths of firelight
Dreams in winter cold and white,
Or in the blue-spun twilight, twilight hours
The air was neither night or day,
But faintly dark with softest light,
When first there glimmered into sight
The Cottage of Lost Play

And why we never found the same
Old cottage, or magic
Track that leads between a silver sea,
Between a silver sea
And those old shores and gardens fair
Where all things are that ever were -
We know not, You and Me
We know not, You and Me

Those old shores and gardens fair
Where all things are
That ever were

The air was neither night or day,
But faintly dark with softest light,
When first there glimmered into sight
The Cottage of Lost Play
And those old shores and gardens
Where all things are that ever were
We know not, You and Me,
We know not, You and Me

And these old shores
And gardens fair
Where all things are
That ever were [before]
Air was neither night or day
But faintly dark with softest light
When first there glimmered
The Cottage of Lost Play 



Long Lost to Where No Pathway Goes 
My star, I saw it high and far
At the parting of the ways
A light on the edge of the outer night
Like silver set ablaze
Where the round world plunges steeply down
But on the old roads goes
As an unseen bridge that on arches runs
To coasts that no man knows

I would not find the burning domes and sands
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the snows
Nor seek in mountains dark the landscapes of the men
Long lost to where no pathway goes

But where they bloom those flowers fair
In what air or land they grow
What words beyond the world I heard
If you would seek for know

In a boat then, brother, far afloat
You must labour in the sea
And find yourself things out of mind:
You will learn no more of me

I would not find the burning domes and sands
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the deadly snows
Nor seek in mountains dark the landscapes of the men
Of long lost to where no pathway goes

There the twain enfolded,
Phantom twilight, phantom twilight,
And dim the mazes dark, unholy.

I would never find the burning domes and sands
Where reigns the sun, nor dare the snows
Nor seek in mountains dark, the landscapes of the men
Long lost to whom no pathway goes 


The Glory Disappears 
Yet, if the wind breathe soft, the curling waves
That break against the shore, shall lull my mind
And scorn against all enemies prepared
And with the food of pride sustained my soul
In solitude

Sad was I, to pain depressed
Importunate and heavy load
My destiny has found me here
Upon this lonely road

And many thousands now are sad
Wait the fulfilment of their fear
For I must die who is their stay
Their glory disappears

Now I am dead and gone, my friend
Life's pain has come to end
Your star will guide my soul
To ride the winds above 


Like Some Snow-White Marble Eyes
How countless they congregate
O'er our tumultuous snow
Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
When wintry winds do blow

As if with keenness for our fate
Our faltering few steps on
To white rest, and a place of rest
Invisible at dawn

And yet with neither love nor hate
Those stars like some snow-white
Morgoth snow-white marble eyes
Without the gift of sight

Upon this star I fixed my eye
All over the wide land
My horse moved on, hoof after hoof
He raised and never stopped
When down behind the cottage roof
At once the planet dropped


Where Hope and Daylight Die
Still here I wake and I think of you
I see you far away
Answer my call
Can you hear my voice
I hear you

For we are gone and forever lost
Broken here I lie
Beneath the shadow sink
Where daylight dies
I wake for you

In better lands the sun may shine
And green leaves on trees spring
Their opening and blossoming
But here the raven sing

But still I stand and think of
Days when grass was green
And my heart was so young
They 've never been past
Forever lost 


The Rotting Horse on the Deadly Ground
Wars of great kings and clash of armouries
Whose swords no man could tell, whose spears
Were numerous as wheat field’s ears
Rolled over all the great lands, and seas

Were loud with navies, their devouring fires
Behind the armies burned both fields and towns
And sacked and crumbled or to flaming pyres
Were cities made, where treasuries and crowns

Kings and their folk, their wives and tender maids
Were all consumed. Now silent are those courts
Ruined the towers, whose old shape slowly fades
And no feet pass beneath their broken ports

I need no call of clamant bell that rings
Iron tongued in the towers of earthly kings

Take a ride on, ride on,
on your rotting horse
on that deadly ground
Take a ride, ride on,
on your rotting horse
with a pounding sound.

Here on the stones and trees there lies a spell
Of unforgotten loss, of memories more blest
than mortal wealth.
Here undefeated dwell the fog immortal
under withered elmes,
Alalminore one in ancient realms 


The Shadow Lies Frozen on the Hills 
Farewell we call to the earth and hall
Though wind may blow so fast rain may fall
We must away ere break of day
For over wood, tree and mountain tall.

With foes ahead, behind us dread
Beneath the sky's our bed
Until at last our toil be passed
Our journey's done with sped

Beneath the moon and under a tall star
I wandered so far from northern lands
Bewildered on enchanting charming ways
So far from the days of mortal lands

From gashing of the narrow ice so near
Where shadows lie frozen on the hills top
From neither heats and burning glowing waste
I'm turning in haste and fear. 


The Loud Music of the Sky 
What I am, I must not show
What I am thou could (not know)
Something between heaven and hell
Something that neither stood nor fell
Something that through thy wit or will
May work thee good, may work thee ill

Neither substance quite, nor shadow
Haunting lonely moor and meadow
Dancing by the haunted spring
Riding on the whirlwinds wing

Far less happy, for we have
Help nor hope beyond the grave
Man awakes to joy or sorrow
Ours the sleep that knows no morrow
This is all that I can show
This is all that you may know

A year there is a lifetime
And a second but a day
And an older would will meet you
Each morn' you come away

The thunder's noise is our delight
And lightning makes us day by night
And in the air we dance on high
To the loud music of the sky 


A Distant Flame Before the Sun
I sit beside the fire and think
Of how the world will be
When winter comes without a spring
That I shall ever see

I sit beside the fire and think
Of people long ago
And people who will see a world
That I shall never know

I sit beside the fire and think
Of older times that were before
I listen for returning feet
And voices at my door

On high above the mists I came
A distant flame before the sun
A wonder ere the waking dawn
Where grey the nordland waters run
In elder days and years of yore 



A New Power Is Rising
Ash nazg gimbatul,
Ash nazg thrakatulûk
Agh burzum-ishi krimpatul. 


South Away 
Leave the halls and caverns deep
Were the forests wide and dim
Stoops in shadow grey and grim

Float beyond the world of trees
Past the rushes, past the reeds
Past the marshes, weaving weeds

And the crowns of the seven kings, and the rods of the five wizards.

South away! South away now!
Far away seek the sunlight and the day.

Hail Éomer, King of the Mark. 



In Hollow Halls Beneath the Fells 
Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold

The pines were roaring on the height
The winds were moaning in the night
The fire was read, it flaming spread
The trees like torches blazed with light

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep where dark things sleep
In hollow halls beneath the fells

For ancient kind and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hord
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword

Sample:1. In the darkness bind them 


Our Foes Shall Fall 
The sword is sharp, the spear is long
The arrow swift, the gate is strong
The heart is bold that looks on gold
The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong

The mountain throne once more is freed
O! Wandering fold, the summons heed
Come haste! Come haste! Across the waste
The king of friend and kin has need.

Now call we over mountains cold
Come back unto the caverns old
Here at the gates the king awaits
His hands are rich with gems and gold

The king is come unto his hall
Under the mountain dark and tall
The worm of dread is slain and dead
And ever so our foes shall fall 


The Mountain King's Return
The king beneath the mountains
The king of carven stone
The lord of silver fountains
Shall come into his own!

His crown shall be upholden
His harp shall be restrung
His halls shall echo golden
To songs of yore resung

The woods shall wave on mountains
And grass beneath the sun
His wealth shall flow in fountains
And rivers golden run

The streams shall run in gladness
The lakes shall shine and burn
All sorrow fail and sadness
At mountains king's return

Sample:
1. War has already begun ... so, we come to it in the end.
2. Follow me through the darkness.
