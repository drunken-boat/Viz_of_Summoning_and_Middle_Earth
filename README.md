# Viz_of_Summoning_and_Middle_Earth 
A project for visualization summer school, processing text data of metal band Summoning and geo data of the middle earth.
 
## It's UNfinished and chaotics as you can tell, and I make it public only to push myself, knowing no one cares :)

In lyrics_for_wordcloud.txt, the [Mirdautas Vras lyrics](https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Summoning/Oath_Bound/108254) are written in [neo-Black Speech](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Black_Speech), and I used the English translation to keep the accuracy in word cloud. Similarly, the [Evernight lyrics](https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Summoning/Old_Mornings_Dawn/372416) written in [Quenya](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Quenya) are used in English translation.
