_[The Hobbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit "The Hobbit")_ (1937), Tolkien's first published novel, was not originally part of the larger mythology but became linked to it. Both _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_ (1954 and 1955) took place in the [Third Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Age "Third Age") of [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth "Middle-earth"), while virtually all of his earlier writing had been set in the first two ages of the world. _The Lord of the Rings_ occasionally alludes to figures and events from the legendarium, but such ancient tales are depicted as being remembered by few until the story makes them relevant.

**Middle-earth** is the fictional [setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setting_(narrative) "Setting (narrative)") of much of the English writer [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien "J. R. R. Tolkien")'s fantasy. The term is equivalent to the _[Miðgarðr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midgard "Midgard")_ of [Norse mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology "Norse mythology") and _Middangeard_ in [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") works, including _[Beowulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf "Beowulf")_. Middle-earth is the [human-inhabited world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oikumene "Oikumene"), that is, the central continent of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), in Tolkien's imagined [mythological past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoeia "Mythopoeia"). Tolkien's most widely read works, _[The Hobbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit "The Hobbit")_ and _[The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings "The Lord of the Rings")_, are set entirely in Middle-earth. "Middle-earth" has also become [a short-hand term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonym "Metonym") for [Tolkien's legendarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien%27s_legendarium "Tolkien's legendarium"), his large body of fantasy writings, and for the entirety of his fictional world.

Middle-earth is the main continent of [Earth (Arda)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_(Middle-earth) "Arda (Middle-earth)") in an imaginary period of the Earth's past, ending with Tolkien's [Third Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Age "Third Age"), about 6,000 years ago.[[T 1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth#cite_note-letter211-1) Tolkien's tales of Middle-earth mostly focus on the north-west of the continent. This part of Middle-earth is suggestive of Europe, the north-west of the [Old World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World "Old World"), with the environs of [the Shire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth) "Shire (Middle-earth)") [reminiscent of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_in_Middle-earth "England in Middle-earth"), but, more specifically, the [West Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(region) "West Midlands (region)"), with the town at its centre, [Hobbiton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbiton "Hobbiton"), at the same latitude as [Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford "Oxford").

## Which is the most mentioned middle earth place in Summoning lyrics?

## What is Summoning's favourite word?

## Why and how did I visualize this?

By virtue of coorperation with Mrs.Xiang(one of my my recommanders) and books written by Yi-Fu Tuan, I appreciate the attachment of place, and constantly find inspiration in cultural geography. From my perspective, place adds a nostalgic yet perceptible dimension in our life.

Trying to utilize what I learned in PKU viz summer school and link my geography-related background, I initially dived into CHGIS(Chines Historical GIS) data, and made a comparison of territorial changes between 1911 and 1926 by intersection(a vector analysis tool) in QGIS. However, I realized Chinese map is politically sensative to post, before which I thought all coordinate reference systemss are equal and only had geographical, instead of political, difference.

"I wish that there would be a place where I could navigate and lapse worrying about dangerous mistake", said to myself.

Suddenly I noticed the music playing in my earphone, it was Farewell by Summoning, which I'd been listening while imagining the grandiose scenery and heroic wars in the middle earth it portrayed for years and years.

The solemn mountains, vast woods in ever-shadows, and rivers driving golden sunshine had became a place to escape from mundane toils for me.

Arthur Rimbaud had never witnessed the ocean by the time he wrote the poem "The Drunken Boat", but still could narrate it in a magnificant way; J.R.R. Tolkien drew in-depth fantasy maps of his fictional works. 

These lead me into thinking that GIS maybe can be used to analyze fictional place, which is my manifesto in this project.
